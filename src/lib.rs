//! The tetrs library provides a number of low-level tasks for required for
//! tetris gameplay. This library aims to be correct and provide easy extension
//! for new frontends/rotation-systems etc.
//!
//! Intra-module dependencies are reduced as much as possible. If a component
//! does not require knowledge of another component, then it is likely not
//! present. Some helper functions which do not adhere to this philosophy can
//! be located in the `utility` module.
//!
//! Finally, a fairly general high-level abstraction over these is provided
//! with the `engine` module.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use tetrs::import::*;
//!
//! let field = Field::new();
//! let mut block = Block::new(block::Id::I, &field);
//!
//! block.rotate(&field, Rotation::R90);
//! block.shift_extend(&field, Direction::Down);
//! ```
